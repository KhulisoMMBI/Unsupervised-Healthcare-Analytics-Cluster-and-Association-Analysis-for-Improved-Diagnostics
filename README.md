# Project Name
Unsupervised Learning in Healthcare: Fetal Health Classification and CAD Association Analysis

# Overview
This project integrates unsupervised learning techniques to explore two critical healthcare datasets. The first part focuses on clustering fetal health data to refine health status classifications, while the second part uses association rule mining to identify key factors associated with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This comprehensive approach aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and public health strategies, showcasing skills relevant for data science and healthcare analytics roles.

## üìä Project Summary
**Objectives:**
- Refine fetal health classifications by applying cluster analysis to cardiotocogram (CTG) data.
- Identify features most associated with CAD using association rule mining techniques.

**Approach:**
- Utilizes clustering methods such as partitioning, hierarchical, density-based (DBSCAN), and Gaussian mixture models to analyze fetal health data.
- Applies association rule mining algorithms (Apriori, FP-Growth, ECLAT) to discover relationships between patient features and CAD diagnosis.

**Datasets:**
- Fetal Health Dataset: Contains 2126 records of features extracted from CTG exams.
- CAD Dataset: Includes measurements from angiography of 303 patients, indicating presence or absence of CAD.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing: cleaning, standardization
- Cluster Analysis: K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian mixture models
- Association Rule Mining: Apriori, FP-Growth, ECLAT algorithms
